# ohsiha_weather APP

## Description

This is a Singe Page Application to done using the MERN stack (MongoDB for our database, Express and Node for our backend, and React for our frontend). 
It was built as a project for the course TLO-32400 2020-01 Ohjelmallinen sisällönhallinta and the aim for me was to learn more about web development and especially React since this was my first time using it.
